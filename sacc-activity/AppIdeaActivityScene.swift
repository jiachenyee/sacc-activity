He became *fearless* when he realised that *the great war* was a *hoax.* Thus, he went to the *holy ground* where he met a seer called *betty* the *Mad Woman,* who said *“I Know Places* to host the new classes”. She then passed him *the manuscript* to get there. Jia Chen took *the manuscript* and became the *mastermind* of a plan to get there. Following this, he wrote his entire experience on a *message in a bottle* so that people will find out about his adventure in the future, all while experiencing *midnight rain.* “this future will be *ours!* I am *ready for it!”* he exclaimed. He realised that the road led to *Paris,* *Out of the woods,* at *a place in this world,* and so he proceeded to *run* for 9 months, until September, with *snow on the beach.* He wanted to give up, but he remembered Betty’s words saying *“soon you’ll get better”,* so he styled himself up to be *superman* and went to *wonderland.* Alas, *you’ll always find your way back home,* and *the man* got his *karma,* and everything went well from then on. New Swift Accelerator classes are held in *Paris* now, with *the joker and the queen.* The End."))
